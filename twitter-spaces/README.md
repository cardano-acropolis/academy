 1. Features
	1. Algorithmically stabilized by a dynamic basket of goods.
	2. Requires a market crash of 60% or more in order to lose its peg.
 2. Role in the ecosystem
	1. Babel fees
 3. Concerns and discussion
 
Revolution in Scientific Transparency

 1. Pasteur put in his will not to let anyone see his lab notebook.
 2. Fraud and abuse in science as shown by [Elisabeth
    Bik](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01363-z) in [her
    twitter](https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest) along with
    @mortenoxe, @TigerBB8 and @SmutClyde
 3. The field is pushing for more transparency, rigor, and reproducibility.
	1. NIH policies and guidelines
	2. Cytobank and the role of Flow Cytometry
	3. [Journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)
	4. [Ngram](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=rigor+and+reproducibility&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2Crigor%20and%20reproducibility%3B%2Cc0)
 4. Potential strategies to get started
	1. Hash data automatically and store hashes in NFTs on the blockchain.
	2. [Publishing](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)
	3. Publishing anonymously and verifying data authenticity
	4. VABrandon's note that QC and reagents could be stored
       on-chain. I should say that probably hashes will be sufficient,
       but we can do side-chains.
 5. Action items
	1. Task force to identify current projects and implement
       proof-of-concept for data hashing
	2. Task force to imagine how an academic system of anonymous or
       pseudonymous publishing would work.
